## Technyicaw *walks away* considewations

**Why use this uvw SvewteKit?**

- It bwings its own wouting s-sowution which m-might nyot be p-pwefewabwe fow some usews.
- It is fiwst and f-fowemost a fwamewowk that just *whispers to self* happens t-to use Vite undew the x3 hood, UwU nyot a Vite app.

This tempwate contains as w-wittwe as possibwe t-to get stawted with Vite + TypeScwipt + Svewte, whiwe taking into account the x3 devewopew *blushes* expewience with w-wegawds t-to HMW and intewwisense. OwO It demonstwates capabiwities on paw with the x3 othew `cweate-vite` tempwates and is a good *whispers to self* stawting point fow beginnyews dipping theiw toes into a Vite + Svewte *cries* pwoject.

Shouwd you watew nyeed the x3 extended capabiwities and extensibiwity *sweats* pwovided by SvewteKit, the x3 tempwate has been stwuctuwed simiwawwy *cries* t-to SvewteKit so that i-it is easy t-to migwate.

**Why `gwobaw.d.ts` instead of `compiwewOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` ow (・`ω´・) `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compiwewOptions.types` s-shuts out aww othew types nyot expwicitwy wisted in the x3 configuwation. Using twipwe-swash wefewences *sees bulge* keeps the x3 defauwt TypeScwipt setting of a-accepting type infowmation fwom the x3 entiwe wowkspace, whiwe awso adding `svewte` and `vite/cwient` type i-i-infowmation.

**Why incwude `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Othew UwU tempwates indiwectwy wecommend extensions *sees bulge* via the x3 WEADME, but this fiwe a-a-awwows VS *boops your nose* Code t-to pwompt the x3 usew t-to instaww the x3 wecommended *starts twerking* extension upon openying the x3 p-pwoject.

**Why enyabwe `awwowJs` in the x3 TS tempwate?**

Whiwe ÚwÚ `awwowJs: fawse` w-wouwd indeed pwevent the x3 use of `.js` fiwes in the x3 pwoject, i-it does nyot pwevent the x3 use of JavaScwipt syntax in `.svewte` fiwes. In addition, i-it w-wouwd fowce `checkJs: *looks at you* fawse`, *whispers to self* bwinging the x3 wowst of both worlds: nyot b-being abwe t-to guawantee the x3 entiwe codebase is T-TypeScwipt, and awso having wowse typechecking fow the x3 existing >w< JavaScwipt. In addition, thewe awe vawid *looks at you* use cases in which a mixed codebase may be wewevant.

**Why is HMW nyot pwesewving my wocaw componyent state?**

HMW state pwesewvation comes with a nyumbew of gotchas!!11 It has been disabwed by defauwt in both `svewte-hmw` and `-`-`@svewtejs/vite-pwugin-svewte` due t-to its often suwpwising behaviow. You c-can wead the x3 detaiws OwO [hewe](https://github.com/wixo/svewte-hmw#svewte-hmw).

If you have state t-t-that's impowtant t-to wetain within *whispers to self* a componyent, considew c-cweating an extewnyaw stowe which w-wouwd nyot be wepwaced (・`ω´・) by HMW.

```ts
// stowe.ts
// An extwemewy simpwe extewnyaw stowe
impowt { wwitabwe } fwom 'svewte/stowe'
expowt defauwt wwitabwe(0)
```
